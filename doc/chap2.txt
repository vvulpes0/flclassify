  [33X[0;0YThe  following relations, introduced by Green [Gre51], have been fundamental
  in studying the structure of semigroups:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xa\mathrel{\mathcal{L}}b[123X iff [23XS^1 a=S^1 b[123X[133X

        [23Xa\mathrel{\mathcal{R}}b[123X[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xa\mathrel{\mathcal{D}}b[123X iff there is a [23Xc[123X where [23Xa\mathrel{\mathcal{L}}c[123X
        and [23Xc\mathrel{\mathcal{R}}b[123X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  language  is  regular  iff its syntactic semigroup is finite, so for this
  work we can operate in a space where [23X\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{D}[123X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRegular  [23X\mathcal{D}[123X-classes  are sometimes relevant. A [23X\mathcal{D}[123X-class is
  regular iff it contains a regular element.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YTriviality Under Certain Relations[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YMany  important  classes  of  languages are defined by properties related to
  these  relations.  The  simplest  are those corresponding to first-order and
  propositional logic over general precedence.[133X

  implemented as a synonym, so there is no corresponding [10XHasIsStarFree[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  language  is  star-free  iff  it  is  definable  by a generalized regular
  expression  without  the  use  of the star. That is, it is the closure under
  concatenation,  union,  intersection,  and  complement  of singleton sets of
  words.  As  demonstrated  by Sch√ºtzenberger [Sch65], a language is star-free
  iff  its syntactic semigroup is finite and aperiodic. Aperiodic simply means
  that   every   [23X\mathcal{H}[123X-class   is   singleton,  that  the  semigroup  is
  [23X\mathcal{H}[123X-trivial.   McNaughton   and  Papert  show  that  a  language  is
  first-order definable with less-than iff it is star-free [MP71].[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ytrue or false[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDetermine  if a semigroup recognizes only piecewise testable languages. This
  is    implemented   as   a   synonym,   so   there   is   no   corresponding
  [10XHasIsPiecewiseTestable[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  language is piecewise testable iff it is definable by its allowed sets of
  subsequences,  where  a  subsequence  is a (finite) sequence of symbols that
  occur  in order but not necessarily adjacent to one another. As demonstrated
  by  Simon  [Sim75],  a  language  is  piecewise  testable  iff its syntactic
  semigroup  is finite and [23X\mathcal{J}[123X-trivial. This definition corresponds to
  a propositional logic whose propositions are the occurrence of subsequences,
  defined by less-than alone.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [23X\mathcal{L}[123X- and [23X\mathcal{R}[123X-trivial languages are useful in some sense,
  but  have not been given other names in the literature. Thus no synonyms are
  provided.  We  shall see them later when discussing definability by affixes.
  First,  though, let us consider two special subclasses of piecewise testable
  semigroups: Acom and semilattices.[133X
  
  [1X2.1-3 IsAcom[101X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ytrue or false[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDetermine  if  a semigroup is aperiodic and commutative. This is implemented
  as a synonym, so there is no corresponding [10XHasIsAcom[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  corresponding languages are based on restrictions on their multisets of
  symbols,  where  counts saturate at some threshold [23Xt[123X. The special case where
  [23Xt=1[123X  is a restriction on which sets of symbols appear; this smaller subclass
  corresponds to [10XIsSemilattice[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  there  is  a  class  which  contains  all  of the [23X\mathcal{L}[123X- and
  [23X\mathcal{R}[123X-trivial langugaes without moving all the way up to star-free:[133X

  [33X[0;0YDecide  if  a  semigroup  is  in  DA,  that  is,  whether all of its regular
  [23X\mathcal{D}[123X-classes  are  aperiodic semigroups. This is equivalent to asking
  whether  all  regular elements are idempotent. Th√©rien and Wilke demonstrate
  that  this  class  corresponds  precisely  to  first-order definability with
  less-than but only two formal variables [TW98].[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YAffixes[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  section  details  languages defined by sets of permitted affixes. They
  might  just as well be in the later chapter on local properties, but in fact
  they are decidable without invoking the mechanisms of that section.[133X

  [33X[0;0YA  language  is  generalized  definite  iff  it  is  defined  by  a  Boolean
  combination   of   permitted   suffixes.  This  corresponds  to  having  all
  idempotents be [23X\mathcal{D}[123X-related, which trivially makes this a subclass of
  DA.  A  language  is  tier-based  generalized  definite  iff  its  projected
  subsemigroup  is  generalized  definite.  The  projected subsemigroup is the
  semigroup generated by [23XS^1\setminus\{1\}[123X.[133X
